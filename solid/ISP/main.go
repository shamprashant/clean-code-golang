/*
ðŸ§ª Task â€“ Interface Segregation Challenge
You are building a media player system.

ðŸŽ¯ Your scenario:
Some players only support audio.

Some players support both audio and video.

Some devices are record-only, they donâ€™t play anything.

ðŸš§ Your Objective:
Design interfaces that do not force any type to implement unwanted methods.

Implement at least 3 types of devices:

An audio player

A video player

A voice recorder

Keep interfaces small and focused, and use composition where needed.
